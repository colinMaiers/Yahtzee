# Yahtzee
The goal was to make a visual version of Yahtzee using Python and Pygame in Thonny, including dice rolling, locking, scoring, and a game-over condition. Players click to roll dice, lock selected ones, and choose a score category after up to three rolls. I used Python, Pygame, random, and simpleGE, following an object-oriented approach. I learned how to handle input, manage game states, and build a UI with Pygame. I got stuck with locking dice and ending the game correctly. I'd improve the UI and scoring code next time. I mostly stuck to the plan but had to add a intro and end screens. Staying organized with a checklist helped me stay on track.
